The young woman does not reside here and the sheriffs officer did not ask to see verification of residence. This is a serious breach in the code of conduct and ethics and a felony. Sheriffs officers are not permitted to remove any item from a home unless included in a warrant and they are certainly not allowed to aide and abet in a home invasion. It also seems to me in the body language that there is something more then a officer / civilian type interaction. If this is the case then the officer would not allowed to be participate in any capacity in this situation due to a conflict of interest and at the very least without a backup unit to monitor. I have the video of the officer and the young woman leaving my home both carrying items and both putting them in her vehicle.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Oakland sheriffs

Riverside Sheriffs Dept has done nothing but intimidate, violate my privacy rights, and low this man to get away with all he has done. Even tho I have proof that he has beaten me and has almost killed me. From text, pics and credible witnesses they seem to let him go every time. I am here in Anza Vs the cops aren\'t responding to the crimes that are violent. They focus primarily on Marijuana Cultivation and do mostly raids. While you will see that on Anza watch Facebook this community does its own policing most of the time and need to get their priorities in order. I have filed 3 reports. If they would have followed up on the first one when I said he had a firearm I wouldn\'t had been abused and almost killed after that I lost faith in getting help from these officers. So I managed to get by and protect myself staying at the local casino. Which they sabotaged somehow to get me out. I\'m breif on the details due to the lawsuit I will be filing. These officers have made me feel so unsafe while my abuser is left free to believe he is untouchable. I have filed a complaint to the sheriffs delta stating that I was intimated by the officer of the first report. After explaining to him that my abuser said that he worked for the Sheriffs and he was paid to set me up he made a comment stating \\" sounds like tweaker stories\\" at the time their were 7 missing woman in Idyllwild a neighboring city nearby. I was discouraged to proceed with the charges and started to believe my aggressor was telling the truth. Now I\'m pretty much convinced something\'s not right. I am now in the streets fending for myself in this small town. My life is on the line until I can get the media or an attorney I am not safe at all. But I will not give up and will continue to write letters and stand up for my rights and for others that are here and that are not due to their negligence.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Aclu, Marcys law, Riverside Sheriff

I was immediately frightened when I opened the door and saw that there were items out of place.  My rear door was open.  My bedroom doors which were closed were now open and there was a pair of shoes that werent mine (I live alone) in my laundry room and rear door was open.  I immediately called for help and explained that my home had been burglarized.  Deputy Eads from the sheriffs department responded and I explained what I came home to and some things I noticed missing as we walked through the home.  In my bedroom on dresser the deputy saw some orange caps, they were needle caps and he asked me what they were.  I responded wire nuts as that is what I thought at the moment.  He asked me a few more times and I grabbed them and threw them out.  He then abruptly, without looking through the home to see if someone was still present , left my residence without a word. There were items in my outside shed with a chair present and a drink as if someone had been watching me, my back gate was also knocked down.  The deputy never saw any of this since he left without thoroughly investigating. I inquired about the investigation about a month later and they said that there had been no report.  I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor, and since there had been no report I filed a complaint.  About a week later the Sheriff along with 2 other officers and Deputy Eads showed up at my home and the Sheriff began to excuse his officer by saying he wasn\'t aware that it was a burglary that I didn\'t make it clear.  I was visibly upset, pointing to shoes left behind that weren\'t mine, began to explain what was missing and I told 911 what had happened.  Deputy Eads was at my home to look into a reported burglary.  I told the Sheriff I don\'t think that is true and there resolution was for me to provide a list of items missing now it had been 30 days later.  On my list I had several designer purses and one of the officers made the comment that I didn\'t have any designer purses.  I believe in an attempt to degrade me.  (I actually am a collector and I had several hundred handbags that were valuable.)  I am going to share another story where deputy Eads  retaliated against me for reporting him by filing complaint on this incident.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"I reported

The he lied and said he smelled Marijuana, which was a lie because there was none in the car but based on the \\"smell\\" he pulled me out and searched me and my car in the dark on my street 30 yards from my house. After destroying my car and making fun of me for the condition of my car he let me go to go home and try and fix the mess he caused in my car.

The fact that they have publicly endangered every individual on the road at the time through their actions should result in reprimanding the culprit.  The police problem in America is worse and worse is very day.  This is a joke.

hour down Blalock.  They also proceeded to run not one, not two, not three, but FOUR red lights.  They had no emergency lights on and this was a clear abuse or power and privilege.  It should be easy for the police department to identify this inadequate and privilege abusing trash public servant.  The fact that they have publicly endangered every individual on the road at the time through their actions should result in reprimanding the culprit.  The police problem in America is worse and worse is very day.  This is a joke.  The people you are hire to protect and serve the public are endangering and wreckless unreliable sociopaths who have power trips and think they are above the law.

25th 2021, 11:50 am. Somewhere in an Ogden neighborhood.\\n\\nAccording to my GPS I was 10 minutes away from the restaurant I was headed to for a 12:00 PM lunch meeting with a coworker. I was talking to my Dad and stepmom (handsfree) while taking every direction the GPS gave to me. I suddenly came upon a car accident in a semi-residential neighborhood. No biggie. How many times, as a driver, do you come upon a small fender bender and drive around it? I was waiting for an opening to drive around the accident as I saw a car coming towards me from the opposite direction. I pulled into the emergency lane to wait for the oncoming car to pass. I stopped. \\n“Hold on Dad, an officer is approaching my car,” I said to him. \\nA female police officer came to my vehicle, and I rolled down my window. \\n“You need to turn around,” she says.\\n I respond without hesitation, “Ok.” \\n“You need to turn around this way, not that way,” she says as she points her finger towards the curb on my right.  \\nI turn around and see another police officer directing traffic away from the accident. I drive my car toward where the officer is pointing and I’m off, headed to my 12:00 lunch meeting and I don’t think anything about it.  \\n*******************************************\\nI’ve made it to the restaurant and apologized to my friend for being late.\\n“There was an accident. I would have only been five minutes late, not ten,” I said to my friend with a shrug.\\nMy friend and I are catching up we order, and our food finally arrived. Before I get a chance to take the first bite of my sandwich, I get a call from a restricted number.\\n“Hold on. I should answer this,” I say. “Hello, this is Lauren.”\\n“This is Sargent Connors and I have an ATL out for you. You are going to be charged with a CLASS A MISDEMEANOR, which is one level under a felony. We ran your plates and found you. I’m about ready to HAUL YOU OFF TO JAIL, and I have people looking for you!” \\nI gulp and wonder what is going on. I’ve just been smacked with the news that I’m in trouble with the law??????\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” I say. “What is going on?”\\n“Did you come upon an accident recently?” Sgt. Connors said aggressively.\\n“Yes,” I say. \\nHe spoke very aggressively, “You fled from orders. I was screaming and yelling at you, and you ignored me!”\\n“What?” I said. “What do you mean? A female police officer told me to turn around and I saw another officer directing traffic. I followed the other officer.” I was explaining myself in desperation. \\nI quickly realized that I had to defend myself, and fast. I had no idea what this cop was talking about, but according to him, I had broken the law. I didn’t even see this cop. I saw two officers – that’s it. \\nAt this point I am panicking. I have a police officer yelling at me on the phone, telling me that I am charged with a misdemeanor and that I’m going to go to jail and that cops are looking for me. \\n“What?” I say. “I’m sorry. I’m very, very sorry. I did not see you.”\\n“You pulled into the emergency lane, right?” he says again, yelling at me.\\n“Yes,” I said.\\n“Do you realize you went around my vehicle and I was screaming at you and you didn’t stop?!”\\nI honestly had no idea what this guy was talking about. I did not see any other cops besides the two that were on the scene - a female cop who approached my window to give me directions, and a male cop using his forearm to direct traffic. \\n“I’m sorry. I did not see you!” I desperately said. \\n“You are LYING! I don’t believe you!” said Sgt. Connors. \\n“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” I profusely apologized and explained that I genuinely did not see him. \\nThis officer is now getting louder, “DO YOU KNOW SHE WAS WEARING A BODY CAM?” he says.\\n“Okay!” I say. Now I’m really scared.  “But I didn’t do anything wrong!” \\n“I DON’T BELIVE YOU!” he says to me.\\n“Officer, why would I have any reason to flee an accident? I didn’t do anything wrong!”\\n“Because you didn’t want to get a TICKET!” he said, yelling at me.\\n“How would I have known that I was going to get a ticket. I didn’t do anything wrong. Why would I have any reason to flee from an accident? I’m from Salt Lake and was following my GPS. I was meeting a friend for lunch at The Oaks.”\\nNow my blood pressure has noticeably risen, my hands are sweating, and my voice is shrill as I’m saying “sorry” over, and over again.\\n This back and forth went on for about five minutes. I kept explaining myself and apologizing as he kept telling me I was a liar and was going to be charged with a misdemeanor and “hauled off to jail.”\\n“I have a doctors appointment at 2:00!” he says. “You need to come down to the station before I leave!”\\n“Ok!” I am officially shaking. I can’t even think of taking a bite out of my sandwich. “I’m sorry sir, what is your name? \\n\\t“Sargent Connors.”\\n\\t“When is your doctors appointment?”\\n\\t“It’s at 2:00!” he says \\n“Okay,” I say. “I’ll come to the station.”\\nI hang up and look at my friend. “Oh my gosh, what just happened?”\\n*************************************************************\\nMarch 25th 2021, 1:00 pm, Ogden Police Headquarters\\n\\n“I’m here to see Sgt. Connors,” I say to the girl behind the glass.\\nI’m waiting in the lobby. I’m looking at the guns, the flags, the pictures of uniformed men and women thinking to myself how crazy this whole thing is. I woke up this morning ready to go to work, not fight for my freedom! I’m literally an innocent civilian – a single parent who pays taxes on time, hasn’t gotten a ticket in probably 10+ years, I obey the law and don’t like trouble - who caught wind of a guy in a really bad mood. I thought about going to the station with my fists up and my attitude in check. “How dare that guy call me out of the blue and accuse me of NOTHING!” I was mad. I felt unjustly treated…and I was unjustly treated. My right mind pulled through. “Just stay calm and subservient. This guy obviously has an ego to feed.”\\n\\nMoments later a police car pulled up. A man came into the lobby and summoned me by name, asking me to follow him into the parking lot (SUS).\\n\\n\\t“Are you Lauren?!” he asks.\\n\\t“Yes,” I said. I had my purse ready to show proof of identity and insurance.\\n\\t“Had you not showed up I would have let the charge stand!” he says. “But you’re obviously not an Ogden Tweeker and you look okay. So for that, I’m writing you a ticket. This is an infraction.”\\nHe spoke aggressively. He was very pissed off. He had rage in his eyes. I asked him how he could have “taken me to jail.” \\nSgt. Connors said, “Had you had a criminal record, I would have arrested you and taken you to jail!”\\nOh my gosh. I realized this man was somewhat of a lunatic. He acted completely from ego, not reason. He didn’t ask me for identification…and if I really did anything wrong, why didn’t he pull me over as I was driving away from the accident? No, he took the time to find me and THREATEN AND BULLY ME.\\nWhat if I had a criminal record that I had paid my dues for? What if I did look like an “Ogden Tweeker” what if I was another race other than white???? What if I didn’t answer my phone because it said “restricted” and I’m so tired of getting spam calls? \\nThis guy, this Sgt. Connors, has the power to change a life in minutes!!! How many lives has he already ruined to try to prove something??? \\nThese are the questions that filled my head as this guy exercised his authority. THIS IS NOT RIGHT!\\nUniformed Civil Servants SHOULD NOT GET AWAY WITH MISTREATING, BULLYING, AND THREATENING THE VERY CITIZENS THEY ARE TRYING TO PROTECT.\\nWHOSE SIDE IS HE ON? …….HIS OWN! This guy is a disgrace to the police force that I thought I respected. For Connors to fly off the handle and treat people like that is so opposite to what I know police officers to be. \\n\\nI SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH A TICKET! THIS GUY NEEDS TO BE REPORTED FOR MISCONDUCT AND ABUSE OF POWER","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Ogden City Police Department

I am a medical courier and was going to pick up specimens. \\nI had my bright lights on since it is difficult to see on this highway and I was the only person on my side of the highway and was avoiding hitting any animals. I saw headlights flash in front of me from the lane next to me and thought that was odd because there shouldn’t be any oncoming traffic . I naturally turned my brights off but was confused. As I was going to call the non emergency police to report this wreckless driver, I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the vehicle doing a u turn behind me. They then turned on their lights and sirens and I realized for whatever reason, the vehicle going the wrong way in traffic was the police and they were pulling me over. \\n\\nThe officer approached my window and I gave him my license and registration . I explained my proof of insurance was on the app on my phone and asked permission to reach for my phone to show him. He immediately started belligerently screaming at me and threatening me. I remained as calm as I could and responded calmly . I stated “sir, I have been nothing but respectful and you are screaming at me for what? I think you misunderstood what I was saying . I have insurance I was simply saying that the document is on my phone and was asking if I could reach for my phone.”\\nHis demeanor changed and he changed the subject to something completely unrelated and asked if I went to UT martin for school. Which was odd since I have nothing that says UT Martin and it isn’t even remotely close to that location. \\nAt this point, I just wanted to leave so I did what I needed to in this interaction to make it out before he got angry again. \\n\\nI immediately called the police station with no answer. I left a voicemail every day that week with no response. I reached out to the chief and was able to find out he was a sheriff so I reached out to the sheriffs dept. told that supervisor what happened and he stated he would get back to me. He called almost a month later to basically just cover up this officers behavior and blamed his violent screaming on a hearing issue. Respectfully, I am a first responder (EMS) and went through intensive medical - including hearing examinations before I could even be trained to be a first responder so if this officers hearing impairment is an excuse for him to violently threaten and scream at citizens, then maybe he shouldn’t be an officer until that is examined properly. \\n\\nI reached out to the sheriff after being displeased with the chiefs response , who stated he would have someone reach out to me. It has been a month or more and I haven’t heard anything back so I’m reaching out here in hopes this man will be held accountable before his violence takes someone’s life or he gets hurt . If I was not able to remain so calm , I don’t have a doubt that man would’ve hurt me in a physical way that night. \\nI was able to get this officers name, which helped me discover that he has been under investigation before for being under the influence at work and has gone to court for this issue , which doesn’t surprise me one bit . He definitely seemed under the influence when he pulled me over and started screaming at me like an angry drunk. \\nThe officer stated he pulled me over because I had my bright lights on. Which, as I stated , I was the only driver on my side of the highway, it is a divided highway and having your bright lights on is not against the law so I was not affecting anyone . \\n\\nI would be more than happy to share the details of what this officer screamed at me, what the chiefs unacceptable response was to this deputies behavior and how it is clear they’re going to continue covering up this mans violence until someone is genuinely hurt by him . \\n\\nAs a first responder myself, this behavior is unacceptable and I will not hesitate to reach out to those who can publicly announce what a danger this man is as an officer of the community. Reaching out to file a complaint on this platform is my last attempt at civilly and professionally reporting this man since I have been jumping through hoops for over two months now.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Contacted Department supervisor and

racially charged accusations against me, when I questioned the employee regarding the remarks the employee became argumentative. I asked for her to call her manger to assist me in resolving the issue. The lady behind me in Menards stated to the employee that her husband was a Sherriff for the McCracken County Sheriff department.  Minutes later a guy walked to me questioning me regarding the incident he never stated his name but stated that he worked for the McCracken County Sheriff department. The incident did not require the assistance of the sheriff in any capacity. He was not on duty at the time or was not officially called to respond but responded to an incident that was racially charged by the employee of Menards and his wife called him. I want to know the policies and procedures to sheriffs responding to incidents when off duty and further escalating and racially insensitive event. I later found out that the Sheriffs name is Ryan Norman.  I contacted the McCracken County Sheriff department on 3/13/21 to file a compliant regarding this issue I spoke with Srgt.

I felt uncomfortable as state police officer I.D. number 4458 was asking me multiple questions right next to my window while not wearing a face mask. The ticket that he provided me is illegible so I cannot see any of the details about the so called infraction. He was absolutely riding my ass for a mile it was obvious he was going to put the lights on at some point. It’s a Friday night and he decides to pull me over while I’m driving perfectly fine. Nice work! I’m sure nobody is out drinking and driving. All that matters is giving somebody a ticket though right. Some officers don’t give a shit about protect and serve. Good work!

working late night for uber eats, I quickly became victimized by the skokie police officer George, J D. I was making a left hand turn onto w golf road, while using a signal. The officer then continues to follow me as I complete my turn. From there, I need to make a lane change to be able to make another left turn, where my drop-off is approaching. I use my signal again, and I keep using it and proceed with getting into the left turn lane. The officer turns on his lights, I proceed with the turn, and pull over. The officer then states that I did not use my signal during a lane change. George issues me a warning. I contacted skokie PD immediately and asked to file a complaint. Eventually the Sgt. reviews the video, and gives me a long drawn out explanation about how the officer was inputting my license plate in his computer, makes a mistake and says that he mispelled my plate number, because the plate came back expired. She said while correcting the number, the officer did not see within that time that I was using my signal, and proceeded to stop me. I drive for uber as my only source of income, most of which is late at night. My mother is disabled, and in August of 2020 my father committed suicide. I\'ve gone through enough things in my life, and to have to deal with the emotional stress of being pulled over, especially when im not in the wrong is very serious to me.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Contact Skokie

Sargent Bently then told me to stand up, I was then put in handcuffs and placed in a squad car. Before being placed in the car, 2 of the 5 officers KNOW me and have HELPED me find Titan when he was loose from chasing a deer or cat. Titan is 15 months old and still very much a puppy. He chases to chase, NOT TO HURT. JPD Officer Fye (DOG CONTROL) has came to help too, giving me tips and suggestions on how best to handle puppies; as I do not have children and have never had a puppy before. Never has any of tye JPD officers mentioned ABUSE or NEGLECT at any time! \\nThen, the 4 remaining Officers went back into my home and took Titan. I was then taken to the Holding Center. \\nWhile in holding, I was held behind intentionally so that I could not see the Judge, while others went up for arrangement. When I asked why I was held behind, Officer Conti told me I was \\"being punished\\"! I couldn\'t believe my ears! I even said to Conti that it\'s NOT up to the Police to hand out punishment.\\nOfficer Conti also  said \'there are consequences to my (and then he shut up, not finishing his sentence). I was held in booking for 4-5hours, JPD brought my medication with me. I begged Officer Conti for my meds for over an hour! He said \\"I should have taken them earlier\\". Its NOT up to the Police when I take my meds. \\nSo much more happened in booking, I was handcuffed to a bench, put in isolation (away from the others, so they couldnt hear the whole TRUE story). \\nJPD refused to tell me who accused me, when this supposedly happened, never got the Police report. I sat in booking for 4-5 hrs, then released with an appearance ticket! \\nI had to go back to City Hall the following \\nMonday to get the actual Police report \\nJPD refused to tell me where my dog was, Officer Conti AND Sargent Bently said \\"Your \\nnever going to see your dog again\\"! \\nEventually, I found out where Titan was, and contacted them to make arrangements, ask questions and offer help to care for Titan. \\nTitan is at a local boarding center named Pick of the Litter. Patty is the owner. I asked Patty if and when I can visit w Titan and she said that Sargent Bently told her NO!  How can he do that? I then called him and asked if there is a court order in place preventing me from visits, he hung up on me.\\nI\'ve tried to speak with his boss and the Cbief, getting voice mails with out call backs. I have the Police Report from the \\"witnes\\", whom I do not know, the Veterinarian Report, Titans physical reports from the SAME VET who examined him on the day he was taken. Both reports are full of PROOVIBLE,  FALSE, INCORRECT, SLOPPY, DISCRIMINITORY, BIAS,PREDIJUDICUAL information.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Sent documents to every news

As he’s pulling into Lou’s Custom Exhaust. I  come to the stop sign behind the car that was directly behind him.  His  headlights are now shining  on the driver side of my car. Seeing my friend and I as two of the occupants in the vehicle. But not being able to see my two young daughters due to it being night and the slight factory tent on the vehicle. The car in front of me turns. I pull up to the stop sign, I turn on left on Grove st. The officer circle out of the parking lot and follow me. We go down to the stop lights. We take a right on Summer st. We drive up and go left on Pine st. We drive up some more. Go right on Thatcher st. As we start on Thatcher he flash his lights. I pull over immediately, between Thatcher st and Taylor Ave. He comes to the car looks in. See my friend, my daughters, and I. He ask for license and registration. I give him my license. As my friend looks in the glove compartment for the registration. I ask the officer, what happen? He said I bumped the yellow line a couple times. At that point I didn’t want to be confrontational with the officer. So I gave him my information in hopes that he would run it. See that everything legit. And let me be on my way. He didn’t ask me any questions that showed concern about me bumping the yellow line. He didn’t ask if we’re ok. He leaves comes back to the car. Hands me a written warning and say I don’t have to do anything. I told him, I seen you pulling into the parking lot and when we pulled up you looked into my car then followed me. What made you want to follow me. The officer said there was literally no reason. He continued to say to tell you the truth I wasn’t going to stay in the parking lot. I was going to make a U-Turn. But he  didn’t do a  U-Turn. He followed me instead. I ask again so why you follow me? and said it was because it was his sector. But being in your sector doesn’t give you a reason to follow me. I tell him I don’t think I deserve this warning. I’m with my daughter, why would I be swerving? He says it not a big deal. But it is a big deal because what he  don’t know. He not only racially profile my friend and I. He had my daughters nervous shaking and crying in the back seat. Not even acknowledging them. After he lets us go. He he continue to follow us to Massasoit Boulevard.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"I went to the police

Although the arresting officer (O\'Bannon #369) was given proof of insurance ,he said this was not reliable.After spending two days in cook county jail I was discharged and was told my car had been impounded because of an administrative tow seizure...the officer put in his police report the vehicle was used with illegal activity.He said I violated oak lawn ordinance 11-14-1.So now a preliminary hearing has to take place and my car will be seized for 14 days and the judge will decide if I shall forfeit my car due to neferious actions.the administrative fee is 600 apart from any municipal fines, fees, tickets and storage fees.so basically my car is under investigation and the hearing is to determine whether there was probable cause to seize the property, although there was no drug charges against me my vehicle is being held until a decision has been made.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Spoke with supervising

I have been doing this for over 10yrs in three communities, Doral Court, Doral Gardens and Las Vistas. I TNR (trap neuter vaccinate and release as well as feed and give vet care. The female officer heard the complaint of the couple then came over to me already with the attitude that I was at fault, kept interrupting and repeating that I was trespassing  and could not go back to feed, that is not her call to make without speaking with the management company who knows what I have been doing for years and understand it as a service to the community.\\nThe couple complaining claim Jovan, the person in charge at the office had told them he didn\'t want me or the cats there when in fact this wasn\'t true, I tried explaining to the officer she kept repeating you don\'t live here you will be arrested. The 2 officers took their story as being true and would not let me explain they wrote a trespassing warning and escorted me of the property like a criminal I\'m not a child. I\'m not a child and I know the law, I would have never started feeding without permission, the officer simply asked me to sign the form and never bothered to verify the story, I know they didn\'t because I went to the management office and Jovan said he had never said that and would never say that to anyone without notifying them. This was very ne sided and the officer should be ashamed  of how she behaved even the maintenance crew that was present stated that I was treated unfairly.

Solano had no permission to enter my apartment. Solano with his friend illegally entered the balcony that was closed & locked. Then Solano performed illegal search of my storage unit. Then later Solano started fighting with my main door and forcefully trying to break it open even though he had no permission to enter. I was inside with my 7 year old son and we didn\'t allow anybody to enter. I called my lawyer and my lawyer called Solano to understand what the problem was. Solano never replied to my lawyer and to this day didn\'t provide police report copy nor any other details about the incident. My family and my young kids and my neighbours are traumatised by Solano\'s activities. My kids can\'t sleep and are petrified of police. Because of that incident my wife has gotten heart problems that she is dealing with now.\\n\\nI believe Solano may have been advised to harass me by officer Gummel/Kammal from San Jose PD or officer Ovi from Oakland PD.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"I submitted the report to Sunnyvale police","com_share_data":"1","com_record_submitted":"2021-03-01T23:24:08","com_submission_progress":"3","incidents":{"inc":{"@id":"131492","inc_address_city":"San Jose","inc_address_state":"CA","inc_address_zip":"95134","inc_time_start":"2021-02-01T17:00:00","inc_time_end":"2021-02-01T17:30:00"}},"alleg_silver":{"alle_sil":{"@id":"5525","alle_sil_stop_yn":"N","alle_sil_officer_id":"N","alle_sil_search_yn":"Y","alle_sil_search_wrongful":"Y","alle_sil_force_yn":"N","alle_sil_property_yn":"?","alle_sil_arrest_yn":"N","alle_sil_citation_yn":"N","alle_sil_procedure":"Y","alle_sil_neglect_duty":"?","alle_sil_bias":"?","alle_sil_sexual_harass":"N","alle_sil_sexual_assault":"N","alle_sil_intimidating_weapon":"No","alle_sil_repeat_contact":"N","alle_sil_discourteous":"?"}},"links_complaint_dept":{"lnk_com_dept":{"@id":"5904","departments":{"dept":{"@id":"2867","dept_name":"Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety","dept_slug":"CA-sunnyvale-dept-of-public-safety","dept_status":"Active Department","dept_address":"P.O.

\'supposedly\' because of it.

I\'m unable/prevented/having difficulties obtaining records with the FBI/OPD/court and any actual evidence that was supposedly used against me. These include but not limited to transcripts, plus copies of Superior Court of WA - County of Thurston Case No. 19-6-00140-34 (Filed Mar 29 2019). This was in retaliation to the reports of myself speaking AGAINST data mining/collection, other illegal activities/terrorism (Antifa/AFA/ARA support) and a privacy problem downtown at The Society nightclub in Olympia, WA. These issues seem to keep returning every year, just like at The Foundation nightclub in Seattle in 2018 and hurt many businesses.  There may or may not not be any relation but my Facebook account was also HACKED and deleted/unrecoverable. I was sent to Telecare Thurston Mason E&T, want to report/investigate the facility for Improper Use of Restraint (outside the scope of the law, that made me exceptionally drowsy/sleepy during the day and lazy, not wanting to do much of anything, all FORCED upon me WITHOUT evidence or history). They gave me Brexpiprazole (Rexulti), an Antipsychotic and I had NO/ZERO idea why it was needed or why I was being forced to take it. The claim is due to the POLICE/FBI information that was provided to them and they MUST OBEY! My actual prescribing medical team doesn\'t agree with that medicine and didn\'t even know about it either. Their team/facility lied about a condition. I AM NOT PRESCRIBED ANY ANTIPSYCHOTIC and don\'t need any as said by my medical team.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"OPD, FBI, FTC, HHS/HIPPA, NAMI,

Neglect of Duty, Policy or Procedure Violation","com_summary":"In 1986 my adoptive father, Don Haynes admitted to raping me to the Wilson County Sherriffs Office. Don was read his Miranda rights but never arrested. He returned home to his wife, me & my baby sister. In 1997 I tried to file a police report to WCSO & was told the SOL had run out. In 2020, I found a loophole: from 1978-1989 Aggravated Rape of a child under 13 was punishable by life in prison thus no SOL. In July 2020, I tried to file another police report with WCSO. I met with ADA Swink & Detective  Meckleberg. I showed them the TCA & they said they had never heard of it & they’d “get around to looking it up.” I drove to WCSO the next day. I waited awhile until Detective Meckleberg came out. I asked if they confirmed that there was no SOL. But they didn’t take me seriously. I asked to share my story with Detective Meckleberg. She has both audio & video of that day. A week later, I asked for the police report & was told there wasn’t one. I called the TBI & was transferred to Agent Rielly Gray. We met & I told my story. She believed in me!! She is my hero! I asked if the TBI would confront Don & save some legwork because he would confess again. The TBI found the buried evidence from 1986. On 8/13/2020 the TBI went to Dons house. He confessed again along with Doris Haynes & Rebecca Shaffer. On 11/13/2020 Donald Haynes was arrested for 6 counts of rape. Doris Haynes bailed him out in 4 hours. He waived the arraignment & to this very day is walking the streets of Wilson County and endangering other people. The next court date is 4/19/2021 in Wilson Co. ADA Reddick of Rutherford Co is my prosecutor of the rape due to the conflict of interest in Wilson Co. and the fact that I wouldn’t find an unbiased Judge. I asked for a change of jurisdiction due to Wilson Co being corrupt. The rape case is going in front of a Wilson Co judge. There is no way to get a fair trial as the victim. Wilson Co will continue to cover this up. This has to be illegal. They endangered me and any other person on the street and they have violated both my civil & constitutional rights. I’m no attorney, but I’m sure there is more evidence they are covering up pertaining to this case. I can prove all of this. Please help me.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Filed police reports. Contacted the TBI.

Steve Funk my family and I were appalled by his lack of professionalism and worse, his disregard for our personal safety. \\n\\nSpecifically, in response to my erroneous decision to drive past a traffic sign placed in the road, Dep. Funk aggressively sped out of a hiding spot and quickly advanced. After stopping within a few inches of my front bumper and leaving his lights flashing he trained a spotlight in my face and left it there for the duration of the encounter. His tone of voice and abrupt demeanor when he requested my license indicated anger and he remained forceful and apparently upset throughout, a reaction seemingly disproportionate compared to my low-speed traffic infraction that only put consenting adults at risk. Further, I offered calm compliance with his orders and have a nearly spotless driving record (I\'ve only been pulled over one other time in 20 years of driving). Later, a quick look at the Nike logo covered by a red, \\"no-entry\\" sign posted on his online profile (https://www.facebook.com/Funkster) seemed to confirm Dep. Funk\'s antipathy toward members of his community. I live in Clackamas County and my wife works for Nike and Dep. Funk\'s public rejection of her employer makes me dread future encounters. \\n \\nWorse than his angry demeanor and inflammatory social media posts was Dep. Funk’s apparent disregard for the danger we faced during the traffic stop. Immediately after stopping our car Dep. Funk told us the traffic signs were to prevent driving next to a dangerously unstable slope and warned that the slope might slide further. He then proceeded to ignore this warning and conducted the entire traffic stop, which spanned several minutes, with our car positioned directly under the hillside. When my brother respectfully asked if we should move to reduce the danger, Dep. Funk seemed to confirm both his anger at my family and his disregard for our safety by responding sharply with, \\"You should get your head out of your butt.\\" \\n\\nWhile I appreciate Dep. Funk’s intent to protect drivers on a dangerous section of road, his actions, including uncourteous in-person and online behavior and dismissal of stated danger, left me and my family hurt and fearful. We did not feel that we had interacted with a \\"world-class sheriff,\\" which is the professed vision of Dep. Funk\'s office. I hope he has an opportunity to review this encounter and improve interactions in the future.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Sent to Clackamas County Sheriff\'s Office","com_share_data":"1","com_record_submitted":"2021-02-19T00:13:52","com_submission_progress":"3","incidents":{"inc":{"@id":"129002","inc_address_city":"Oregon City","inc_address_state":"OR","inc_address_zip":"97045","inc_time_start":"2020-12-22T15:40:00","inc_time_end":"2020-12-22T16:30:00","inc_public":"1"}},"alleg_silver":{"alle_sil":{"@id":"5340","alle_sil_stop_yn":"Y","alle_sil_stop_wrongful":"N","alle_sil_officer_id":"N","alle_sil_search_yn":"N","alle_sil_force_yn":"N","alle_sil_property_yn":"N","alle_sil_arrest_yn":"N","alle_sil_citation_yn":"Y","alle_sil_citation_excessive":"N","alle_sil_procedure":"Y","alle_sil_neglect_duty":"N","alle_sil_bias":"N","alle_sil_sexual_harass":"N","alle_sil_sexual_assault":"N","alle_sil_intimidating_weapon":"No","alle_sil_repeat_contact":"N","alle_sil_discourteous":"Y"}},"links_complaint_dept":{"lnk_com_dept":{"@id":"5422","departments":{"dept":{"@id":"5780","dept_name":"Clackamas County Sheriff\'s Office","dept_slug":"OR-clackamas-county-sheriffs-office","dept_type":null,"dept_status":"Active Department","dept_verified":"2021-02-19T00:27:27","dept_email":"ccsopsu@clackamas.us","dept_phone_work":"503-785-5000","dept_address":"2223 Kaen Rd.","dept_address_city":"Oregon City","dept_address_state":"OR","dept_address_zip":"97045","dept_address_county":"Clackamas","dept_score_openness":"90","dept_address_lat":"45.330346","dept_address_lng":"-122.5999495","dept_op_compliant":"1"}}}},"links_complaint_oversight":{"lnk_com_over":{"@id":"1796"}},"officers":{"off":{"@id":"1195","off_role":"Subject Officer","off_badge_number":"30850","off_body_cam":"?","off_duty_status":"On-Duty","off_uniform":"Y","off_used_profanity":"N","person_contact":{"prsn":{"@id":"11179"}},"physical_desc":{"phys":{"@id":"6000","phys_gender":"M","phys_age":null,"phys_height":"70","phys_body_type":"Athletic/Muscular","physical_desc_race":{"phys_race":{"@id":"3059","phys_race_race":"White/Caucasian"}}}}}},"civilians":{"civ":[{"@id":"8126","civ_is_creator":"Y","civ_role":"Victim","civ_camera_record":"Y","civ_given_citation":"Y","person_contact":{"prsn":{"@id":"11167","prsn_address_city":"Lake Oswego","prsn_address_state":"OR"}},"physical_desc":{"phys":{"@id":"5990","phys_gender":"M","physical_desc_race":{"phys_race":{"@id":"3054","phys_race_race":"White/Caucasian"}}}},"injury_care":{"inj_care":{"@id":"2395"}}},{"@id":"8134","civ_role":"Victim","civ_give_name":"Y","civ_give_contact_info":"Y","civ_resident":"N","civ_camera_record":"N","civ_given_citation":"N","person_contact":{"prsn":{"@id":"11178"}},"physical_desc":{"phys":{"@id":"5999","phys_gender":"M","phys_age":"25-34","phys_height":"76","phys_body_type":"Athletic/Muscular","physical_desc_race":{"phys_race":{"@id":"3058","phys_race_race":"White/Caucasian"}}}},"injury_care":{"inj_care":{"@id":"2397"}}}]},"vehicles":{"vehic":{"@id":"575","vehic_complaint_id":"248919","vehic_is_civilian":"1","vehic_transportation":"Car"}},"scenes":{"scn":{"@id":"131626","scn_is_vehicle":"Y","scn_type":"Outdoor public space (includes roads, sidewalks, parks, etc.)","scn_cctv":"?","scn_is_vehicle_accident":"N","scn_how_feel":"Scared","scn_desires_officers":"Sent to counseling or mediation","scn_desires_depts":"Stronger accountability systems for police misconduct"}}},{"@id":"248763","com_public_id":"870","com_status":"Investigated (Closed)","com_type":null,"com_publish_officer_name":"1","com_publish_user_name":"1","com_privacy":"Submit Publicly","com_award_medallion":"Gold","com_all_charges_resolved":"Y","com_anyone_charged":"Y","com_attorney_want":"N","com_attorney_has":"N","com_alleg_list":"Wrongful Detention, Excessive Citation, Discourtesy","com_summary":"In December 2019, I became a local celebrity after posting a YouTube video about how I got criminal charges for failure to register my bicycle in Montgomery County, MD. The original incident happened the previous June after I stopped my bike to witness two Montgomery County Police officers detaining a black teenage boy. Noticing me, the officers ended that detention. \\n\\nWithin sight of the officers, I approached the teenager, handed him a know-your-rights card, and headed home. A few minutes later, an officer from the earlier detention, Christopher Brown,  pulled me over for failing to stop my bicycle at a stop sign. Moments later, his partner Corporal Jason Halko arrived, and I began recording with my phone. \\n\\nAs the first officer wrote up my ticket, the second officer asked if I had a mandatory county registration sticker on my bicycle. I did not, so they wrote me a second ticket. To my dismay, both got written up as criminal charges, requiring me to get a lawyer for my mandatory court date. When that day came, neither officer appeared, and the prosecutor dropped the charges. A few weeks later, I uploaded my video, which sparked a fierce local backlash against the mandatory bicycle registration law. The local broadcast news networks jumped on the story, and the county council passed a bill, with unanimous support, to repeal the law.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Because

Today was the second time that the officer stopped me being the first happened on December 24, 2020.\\n\\nThe first time I was stopped for not having stopped completely at a stop sign and continuous act, other crimes were imputed to me since my california license was expired and my florida registration as well as the license have not yet been changed to Massachusetts. The first time that I was stopped, the policeman mentioned above was harsh in his words, but I did not feel offended or discriminated even when the policeman Kevin M Bate having the reputation of immigrant hunter in Nantucket.\\n\\nI went to court for that and there I was able to explain my situation to the judge.  I could not change my license plate until I had a valid drive license and I was also unable to change my license to the State of Massachusetts for the same reason.  So, I renewed my drive license online and I am waiting for it to arrive at my home in California and after that I will remedy this situation. Probably  I will go to court again for the new episode but this time I felt very disrespected by officer Kevin M Bates and for that reason I would like to open a complaint against him.\\n\\nOn the date and time of what happened, after I explained my situation and what I said to the judge when I went to court, he, Kevin, said: “because you are illegal you should understand that you will not be able to resolve this”.  Shortly after he spoke, he started walking towards the police vehicle and I asked him what made me an illegal person as he himself said.  True officer said if my visa had already expired I was an illegal. So I realized that either he was discriminating against me or he didn\'t understand what I said and then I over said, \\"Sir, I\'m not illegal and I\'m just waiting for my green card, what makes me illegal like you said?\\". After I said that he in an attempt to offend me even more saying  “I don’t give a shit for your history”.  And I asked him, what did you say? Then he said that he no longer wanted to know about parallel issues and that he only wanted to know about the condition of my car, since it was the same thing that started with issues parallel to what happened when he called me illegal. I would like to point out that regardless of the immigration situation of each one, a policeman should never disrespect a citizen, regardless of which country he is from, especially before investigating whether he is talking to someone illegal or not.  And about the bad words.  Is this how a state police officer is trained to treat people?","com_tried_other_ways":"N","com_share_data":"1","com_record_submitted":"2021-02-16T21:33:42","com_submission_progress":"3","com_is_mobile":"1","incidents":{"inc":{"@id":"128205","inc_address_city":"Nantucket","inc_address_state":"MA","inc_address_zip":"02554","inc_time_start":"2021-02-16T13:30:00","inc_time_end":"2021-02-16T14:30:00","inc_public":"1"}},"alleg_silver":{"alle_sil":{"@id":"5311","alle_sil_officer_id":"Y","alle_sil_officer_refuse_id":"N","alle_sil_search_yn":"N","alle_sil_force_yn":"N","alle_sil_property_yn":"N","alle_sil_arrest_yn":"N","alle_sil_procedure":"Y","alle_sil_neglect_duty":"N","alle_sil_bias":"Y","alle_sil_sexual_harass":"N","alle_sil_sexual_assault":"N","alle_sil_intimidating_weapon":"Not sure","alle_sil_repeat_contact":"Y","alle_sil_repeat_harass":"Y","alle_sil_discourteous":"N"}},"links_complaint_dept":{"lnk_com_dept":{"@id":"5261"}},"links_complaint_oversight":{"lnk_com_over":{"@id":"1763","lnk_com_over_submitted":"2021-04-17T00:57:49"}},"officers":{"off":{"@id":"1150","off_role":"Subject Officer","off_body_cam":"?","off_duty_status":"On-Duty","off_uniform":"Y","off_used_profanity":"N","person_contact":{"prsn":{"@id":"10908"}},"physical_desc":{"phys":{"@id":"5820","phys_gender":"M","phys_age":null,"phys_body_type":"Medium/Average","physical_desc_race":{"phys_race":{"@id":"2962","phys_race_race":"White/Caucasian"}}}}}},"civilians":{"civ":[{"@id":"7993","civ_is_creator":"Y","civ_role":"Victim","civ_camera_record":"N","civ_used_profanity":"N","person_contact":{"prsn":{"@id":"10898","prsn_address_city":"Nantucket","prsn_address_state":"MA"}},"physical_desc":{"phys":{"@id":"5813","phys_gender":"M","physical_desc_race":{"phys_race":{"@id":"2960","phys_race_race":"Hispanic/Latinx"}}}},"injury_care":{"inj_care":{"@id":"2329"}}},{"@id":"7998","civ_role":"Witness","civ_give_name":"Y","civ_give_contact_info":"N","person_contact":{"prsn":{"@id":"10906"}},"physical_desc":{"phys":{"@id":"5819","phys_gender":"F","phys_age":"25-34","phys_body_type":"Not sure","physical_desc_race":{"phys_race":{"@id":"2961","phys_race_race":"Hispanic/Latinx"}}}},"injury_care":{"inj_care":{"@id":"2330"}}}]},"vehicles":{"vehic":{"@id":"546","vehic_complaint_id":"247331","vehic_is_civilian":"1","vehic_transportation":"Car"}},"scenes":{"scn":{"@id":"130753","scn_is_vehicle":"Y","scn_type":"Outdoor public space (includes roads, sidewalks, parks, etc.)","scn_cctv":"N","scn_is_vehicle_accident":"N","scn_how_feel":"Disrespected","scn_desires_officers":"Sent to counseling or mediation","scn_desires_depts":"Stronger accountability systems for police misconduct"}}},{"@id":"247251","com_public_id":"848","com_status":"OK to Submit to Oversight","com_type":null,"com_award_medallion":"Gold","com_all_charges_resolved":"N","com_anyone_charged":"Y","com_attorney_want":"?","com_attorney_has":"N","com_alleg_list":"Wrongful Search, Discourtesy, Policy or Procedure Violation","com_tried_other_ways":"N","com_share_data":"1","com_record_submitted":"2021-02-16T19:43:20","com_submission_progress":"3","com_is_mobile":"1","incidents":{"inc":{"@id":"128164","inc_address_city":"Nicholasville","inc_address_state":"KY","inc_address_zip":"40356","inc_time_start":"2021-02-02T02:00:00","inc_time_end":"2021-02-02T00:00:00"}},"alleg_silver":{"alle_sil":{"@id":"5309","alle_sil_stop_yn":"Y","alle_sil_stop_wrongful":"?","alle_sil_officer_id":"N","alle_sil_search_yn":"Y","alle_sil_search_wrongful":"Y","alle_sil_force_yn":"N","alle_sil_property_yn":"N","alle_sil_arrest_yn":"N","alle_sil_citation_yn":"Y","alle_sil_citation_excessive":"?","alle_sil_procedure":"Y","alle_sil_neglect_duty":"?","alle_sil_bias":"?","alle_sil_sexual_harass":"N","alle_sil_sexual_assault":"N","alle_sil_intimidating_weapon":"No","alle_sil_wrongful_entry":"Y","alle_sil_repeat_contact":"N","alle_sil_discourteous":"Y"}},"links_complaint_dept":{"lnk_com_dept":[{"@id":"5237","departments":{"dept":{"@id":"17915","dept_name":"Kentucky State Police","dept_slug":"KY-kentucky-state-police","dept_type":null,"dept_status":"Active Department","dept_verified":"2021-04-20T01:18:36","dept_phone_work":"(502) 782-1800","dept_address":"919 Versailles Rd","dept_address_city":"Frankfort","dept_address_state":"KY","dept_address_zip":"40601","dept_address_county":"Franklin","dept_score_openness":"12","dept_jurisdiction_population":"6000000","dept_address_lat":"38.1862985","dept_address_lng":"-84.8214759"}}},{"@id":"5241","departments":{"dept":{"@id":"11716","dept_name":"Nicholasville Police Department","dept_slug":"KY-nicholasville-police-dept","dept_type":null,"dept_status":"Active Department","dept_verified":"2021-04-17T00:52:18","dept_email":"police@nicholasville.org","dept_phone_work":"859.885.9467","dept_address":"510 N.

I would like to know why. Why all this harassment. We’re they gonna shoot him and then say he pulled a gun. He has been charged with 1st degree assault but was found not guilty by self defense.  Instead was found guilty of unlawful possession of a fire arm.and was sentenced to 18 mos.  He has served his time , apparently it wasn’t enough cause he still being followed and harassed. Now they are charging 3 Tow fees because the first tow truck was a larger one that they subsequently waved own . The second one was the one that actually towed the car. The third one was when they told him they were going return his vehicle to him and had it towed to the police station and then back to the tow

The other driver failed to yield to oncoming traffic and made an abrupt left turn that caused the collision.  When the police arrived, I was treated if I had caused the accident.  Two of the assisting officers made me suffer through a field sobriety test.  They had zero compassion for my injuries and became more aggressive and belligerent toward me after I passed their breathalyzer test.  The tall bald officer that conducted the tests then began accusing me of being home drinking liquor all day and expressed how much he hates how much people like me lie to him.  I tried to explain that my wife and I had just recently returned home from work and were on our way to get dinner for our family.  I asked him why he was treating me like a criminal and he continued to repeat what he had said about me being home drinking liquor all day.  I thought about how I was being treated although I did not cause the accident and how I had just started a new job this same day and how my car is now destroyed and would lose my job because I no longer had transportation.  \\n\\n     After I received a copy of the police report, I noticed that nothing was noted about the field sobriety or breathalyzer testing that was conducted.  I also noticed that they selected the box that stated I had no apparent influence that contributed to the accident.  I feel that these officers racially profiled me and or allowed it to happen and I need your help making sure that justice is served in this matter. \\n\\nReport #20-16134\\n\\nASSISTING OFFICERS:\\n

Reported discovery of flash drive and turned it into officers that came to my home in St. Bonifacius, MN on April 29, 2020.  Detective Christina Olson from the South Lake Minnetonka Police Department was assigned the case.  Detective Olson followed up twice with me over the course of 6 months.  Detective Olson has not returned multiple telephone calls/messages from my daughter, Robyn Lucas or myself about the progress of the case.  No charges have been filed against Jeremiah Caucutt in this case as of Feb. 3, 2021 even though video footage clearly shows him setting up his phone to film my daughter in the

Tyrone de Melo who is a Cleveland police officer asked to borrow 800.00 from me. He said he would repay the money in approximately, two weeks. After the money was loaned to him. He said, a third party check was going to be sent to me. I was to cash the check, take out my 800.00 and give him the rest of the money from the check. I told him, I did not feel comfortable doing that. He claimed that a check was being sent to me. It never arrived. When I questioned him about it. He said the loan company made a mistake. One month goes by. I asked to be repaid my money. He then asks for information like my bank account number, routing number etc. I told him, that was to much information that he was asking. He then accused me of not trusting him. More time went by. Nothing was said, there was no check in the mail. He scammed me out of 846.00. The 46.00 was fees for sending him the money. I spent 200.00 having him served small claims court papers. He then stopped answering my messages in August of 2020. There never was any loan, there never was any check being sent. This was a scam from the beginning. I am also a law enforcement officer in Maryland. We met through his niece who is a friend of mine. She tells me after I loaned him this money, that he has done this to several people before. He thinks he can get away with it because he is a police officer. This is definitely an integrity issue. I have told him many times what I was going to do. He didn’t believe me. I sent him a email on Saturday about this issue. He didn’t reply.","com_tried_other_ways":"N","com_share_data":"1","com_record_submitted":"2021-01-25T20:30:21","com_submission_progress":"3","com_is_mobile":"1","incidents":{"inc":{"@id":"120020","inc_address_city":"Cleveland","inc_address_state":"OH","inc_time_start":"2020-07-25T18:00:00","inc_time_end":"2020-07-25T18:30:00","inc_public":"1"}},"alleg_silver":{"alle_sil":{"@id":"5014","alle_sil_stop_yn":"N","alle_sil_officer_id":"N","alle_sil_search_yn":"N","alle_sil_force_yn":"N","alle_sil_property_yn":"N","alle_sil_arrest_yn":"N","alle_sil_citation_yn":"N","alle_sil_procedure":"Y","alle_sil_neglect_duty":"N","alle_sil_bias":"N","alle_sil_sexual_harass":"N","alle_sil_sexual_assault":"N","alle_sil_intimidating_weapon":"No","alle_sil_repeat_contact":"Y","alle_sil_repeat_harass":"N","alle_sil_discourteous":"N"}},"links_complaint_dept":{"lnk_com_dept":{"@id":"3897","departments":{"dept":{"@id":"3010","dept_name":"Cleveland

My nephew has been through some very traumatic situations, but those traumatic things happened at the hands of some “disturbed idiot”. When traumatic things happen & the one’s who are supposed to protect & serve mock you & say, “oh what do you want me to do arrest him!?” & treat you like you’re stupid by repeating himself over & over, while talking over you & saying, “I don’t think you understand!”  My nephew was more grown than the officer &  he told the cop that he was making him mad & he didn’t want to talk to him anymore…the cop told my nephew, “good! Get mad!” The officer was so unprofessional that I lost my cool and said,  “they should defund His ass!” There really should be some extra training on how the officers should treat people. I understand sometimes situations get escalated,  but come on arguing with a kid that’s been traumatized by having a gun pulled on them! The officers conduct was exactly why people want to defund the police! Officers should protect & serve not violate & abuse people with their power. I admit that I let the bully with a badge get under my skin & I have thick skin! If these cops would get reprimanded for any & all misconduct then maybe some of these people killed by cops would still be alive today!

They have been harassing me relentlessly prior to this and purposely mishandled this on purpose. Since then they have made a victim serval more times and caused physical harm to me . In one such case I was screamed at and refused medical treatment. I\'ve been followed at work and threated many times . Their cruelty has steadily increased in each case .

The message was clear from Hughes that I should not have been driving in Lynbrook at the time I was illegally detained because I am African American. Other African Americans have shared their experience with me regarding the Lynbrook Police Department treatment towards them in similar circumstances. Simple misconduct like Hughes did to me can lead to tragedies like what happened to George Floyd and other African Americans nationally. This police misconduct has to stop. All charges were dismissed on November 30, 2020. I have attached proof and have retained copies of the tickets. I am considering filing a Civil Suit against Police Officer Hughes and the Lynbrook Police Department. Please investigate.","com_tried_other_ways":"N","com_share_data":"1","com_record_submitted":"2020-12-07T05:32:36","com_submission_progress":"3","incidents":{"inc":{"@id":"105132","inc_borough":"Outside NYC","inc_address_city":"Lynbrook","inc_address_state":"NY","inc_address_zip":"11563","inc_time_start":"2020-09-21T22:55:00","inc_time_end":"2020-09-21T23:35:00","inc_public":"1"}},"alleg_silver":{"alle_sil":{"@id":"4269","alle_sil_stop_yn":"Y","alle_sil_stop_wrongful":"Y","alle_sil_officer_id":"N","alle_sil_search_yn":"N","alle_sil_force_yn":"N","alle_sil_property_yn":"N","alle_sil_arrest_yn":"N","alle_sil_citation_yn":"Y","alle_sil_citation_excessive":"Y","alle_sil_procedure":"Y","alle_sil_neglect_duty":"Y","alle_sil_bias":"Y","alle_sil_sexual_harass":"N","alle_sil_sexual_assault":"N","alle_sil_intimidating_weapon":"No","alle_sil_repeat_contact":"N","alle_sil_discourteous":"?"}},"links_complaint_dept":{"lnk_com_dept":{"@id":"1408","departments":{"dept":{"@id":"9943","dept_name":"Lynbrook Village Police Department","dept_slug":"NY-lynbrook-village-police-dept","dept_type":null,"dept_status":"Active Department","dept_verified":"2020-12-15T18:18:39","dept_phone_work":"516-599-3300","dept_address":"P.O.

He was unmasked and I asked him to put his mask on for safety. (Other officers were masked, but Doris refused to mask.) There had been an altercation between pro-Trump and anti-Trump protestors and I was photographing throughout the event. As I approached officers surrounding a Trump supporter on Park Street to continue photographing, Doris demanded that I not take photos. I attempted to respectfully let him know that it was my right, protected by the First Amendment to photograph. He began walking toward me in a threatening manner as I made an attempt to argue my point (in a civil tone I might add). He appeared threatening so I started to walk away when I felt his hand on by back shoving me further from the scene. He raised his voice and shouted that I was not allowed to photograph a witness to an event. Finding another vantage point even farther away,  I simply watched the ordeal and even though I was not taking photographs he began shouting again that I needed to move. I was not in any marked crime scene and was standing on public property. I told him I wanted his badge number. He willing gave it to me while also shouting, \\"Or you\'ll do what?\\"  Once he told me Badge 953 I started to walk away but again, he followed me and again began shoved or pushed me multiple times from behind.  No matter how far I walked he continued with his harassing me. We exchanged words, though he was shouting so much I\'m not sure he heard anything I had to say. Other officers were civil, doing their job, protecting people and working to diffuse any potential unrest. Doris was doing all he could to antagonize. It\'s not surprising to me that he has so many complaints issued against him. He is the BPL\'s worst nightmare when it comes to maintaining or upholding a positive reputation.","com_officer_injured":"N","com_tried_other_ways":"N","com_share_data":"1","com_record_submitted":"2020-11-21T21:19:48","com_submission_progress":"3","incidents":{"inc":{"@id":"104886","inc_address_city":"Boston","inc_address_state":"MA","inc_address_zip":"02133","inc_time_start":"2020-11-21T13:15:00","inc_time_end":"2020-11-21T13:30:00","inc_public":"1"}},"alleg_silver":{"alle_sil":{"@id":"4250","alle_sil_stop_yn":"N","alle_sil_officer_id":"Y","alle_sil_officer_refuse_id":"N","alle_sil_search_yn":"N","alle_sil_force_yn":"Y","alle_sil_force_unreason":"Y","alle_sil_property_yn":"N","alle_sil_arrest_yn":"N","alle_sil_citation_yn":"N","alle_sil_procedure":"Y","alle_sil_neglect_duty":"?","alle_sil_bias":"Y","alle_sil_sexual_harass":"N","alle_sil_sexual_assault":"N","alle_sil_intimidating_weapon":"No","alle_sil_repeat_contact":"N","alle_sil_discourteous":"Y","alle_sil_animal_force":"N"}},"links_complaint_dept":{"lnk_com_dept":{"@id":"1253","departments":{"dept":{"@id":"4204","dept_name":"Boston Police Department","dept_slug":"MA-boston-police-dept","dept_type":null,"dept_status":"Active Department","dept_verified":"2020-12-17T15:07:15","dept_email":"311@boston.gov","dept_phone_work":"617-343-4500","dept_address":"1 Schroeder Plaza","dept_address_city":"Roxbury Crossing","dept_address_state":"MA","dept_address_zip":"02120","dept_address_county":"Suffolk","dept_score_openness":"58","dept_tot_officers":"2713","dept_jurisdiction_population":"617594","dept_address_lat":"42.3338046","dept_address_lng":"-71.0914456"}}}},"links_complaint_oversight":{"lnk_com_over":{"@id":"1218","lnk_com_over_submitted":"2020-12-06T00:00:00"}},"civilians":{"civ":{"@id":"4922","civ_is_creator":"Y","civ_role":"Victim","civ_chase":"?","civ_victim_what_weapon":"No weapon","civ_camera_record":"N","civ_used_profanity":"N","civ_has_injury":"N","civ_given_citation":"N","person_contact":{"prsn":{"@id":"4794","prsn_address_city":"Brookline","prsn_address_state":"MA"}},"physical_desc":{"phys":{"@id":"1996","phys_gender":"M","physical_desc_race":{"phys_race":{"@id":"1092","phys_race_race":"White/Caucasian"}}}},"injury_care":{"inj_care":{"@id":"606"}}}},"scenes":{"scn":{"@id":"105474","scn_is_vehicle":"N","scn_type":"Outdoor public space (includes roads, sidewalks, parks, etc.)","scn_cctv":"?","scn_is_vehicle_accident":"N","scn_how_feel":"Threatened","scn_desires_officers":"Other","scn_desires_depts":"Better training for officers"}},"force":{"for":{"@id":"85333","for_com_id":"200825","for_against_animal":"N","for_type":"Pushing","for_how_many_times":"6","for_while_handcuffed":"N","for_while_held_down":"N","force_body_parts":{"frc_bdy":{"@id":"257","frc_bdy_part":"Torso"}},"links_civilian_force":{"lnk_civ_frc":{"@id":"62","lnk_civ_frc_civ_id":"4922","lnk_civ_frc_force_id":"85333"}}}}},{"@id":"200743","com_public_id":"369","com_status":"Submitted to Oversight","com_type":null,"com_publish_officer_name":"1","com_publish_user_name":"1","com_privacy":"Submit Publicly","com_award_medallion":"Gold","com_anyone_charged":"N","com_attorney_want":"N","com_attorney_has":"N","com_file_lawsuit":"N","com_alleg_list":"Unreasonable Force, Intimidating Display of Weapon, Wrongful Detention, Discourtesy","com_summary":"On November 17th, 2020 at about 1:15 – 1:25pm, I went to pickup lunch at Jerry’s Subs and Pizza at 8517 Colesville road in Silver Spring. I work at Sport Honda Service Center, 1006 East West Highway, Silver Spring. I parked my car on Ramsey Avenue at the corner of Colesville road, across the street from Choice Dental Care. I picked up my food from Jerry’s and proceeded to walk back to my car. When I got to my car, I opened my door, reached over, put the food on the passenger seat, put my drink in the cup holder and stuck my car keys in the ignition (my car door was still open) and in a split second, out of nowhere a Montgomery County police office (by himself) pulled in front of my car, came out and pulled an AR-15 gun on me. I asked what’s going on, what did I do. I told him that I just came from Jerry’s to get food. The officer then asked me to turn around and put my hands on the car (my car) and he stuck the gun in my back (I was never handcuffed). I was never so afraid in my life; my only thought was oh God I’m dead. I tried to tell him that I just came from Jerry’s for food, the food was in my car, he then asked me to sit on the ground with my hands behind my back (not on the sidewalk but in the street). The officer then proceeded back to his vehicle and about 10-seconds later he speeds away in his vehicle leaving me sitting in the street with my hands behind my back, no explanation or apology. He never came back or said I was free to go.\\nI was so stunned, that all I know is, it was a white police office wearing his PPE mask. My mind was racing and so afraid that I did not think to get his patrol car number or anything like that. However, I do know that the businesses across the street have security cameras that would have picked up the incident. I’m pro-police, I have family members who are in law enforcement but dear God this was terrifying.\\nIs it that easy for someone to be mistaken by the police and sometimes end up dead for getting lunch? I was so terrified! I’ve seen the video with George Floyd being murdered and heard about many incidents with blacks being shot and killed by the police for no good reason but good Lord, is it that easy, I never thought it was that easy.","com_officer_injured":"N","com_tried_other_ways":"N","com_share_data":"1","com_record_submitted":"2020-11-18T22:36:46","com_submission_progress":"3","incidents":{"inc":{"@id":"104844","inc_address_city":"Silver

Frank Lopez of the Maryland State Police sent Trooper Michael Steven Hegedus JR. #4721 & Michael Sauer an email ordering them to do a prohibited person check on Glenn Rosenberg, and to make a threat assessment of same. In the email he sent Trooper Hegedus, he said, \\"Mr. Rosenberg clearly has mental health issues\\". He also said in this email, (You will like what I did in this) No doubt he is referring to the “Mental Health Issues” comment which is why Hegedus also included it in his report. I never met or spoke to Frank Lopez before he wrote this statement, nor were there any medical reports of any kind in the file I received later when I requested a FOIA.  Mr. Lopez also did a full records check of Mr. Rosenberg that did not show any mental health records of any kind. Mr. Lopez did not mention anyone who has had any contact with me in more than thirty years. \\nThis statement is clearly intentional and could only have been written for the purpose of inflicting emotional pain, stress or causing harm to Mr. Rosenberg. It is also highly prejudicial and defamatory and is considered senior abuse. In short, the form it is stated as mirrors a medical / psychiatric diagnosis, which is impersonating a health care professional. I believe it was added at the request of Rona Kramer, so in the future, if I am able to expunge my conviction, which would enable me to own a firearm, could be used to prevent me from owning one. I would be very surprised if he has added this too many others reports in the past if any at all. \\nOn June 3, 2020, @ 6:30AM; Trooper Hegedus & Sauer of the Maryland State Police were at my home, knocking at my door. I answered the door to see what they wanted and went out on the porch to talk to them. I had to tell the troopers to cover their face when I went out to protect myself and they did but I believe at that time it was mandatory to wear face masks by the Governor or receive a citation. They asked about a handgun I know I never owned and told them I sold them over thirty years ago and they should have records of this and the gun dealer.  \\nFrank Lopez called a retired Montgomery County Police Officer, Kenneth Stuart Berger and asked what he remembered about me years before and had to have asked about two particular issues, because this is all Mr. Berger spoke of according to Mr. Lopez\'s report. I can only assume Mr. Berger only mentioned these two issues at the request of Mr. Lopez. Not only was this all lies, Frank Lopez included this in his report.  \\nSidney Kramer, stated he spoke to Mr. Rosenberg only once and he was polite and I never threatened him!!) The file I received from Frank Lopez via FOIA contained Court Records showing the expunged cases which is a violation of the expungement laws. It is also unlawful for Mr. Lopez to ask or convey any information about expunged cases to any non-government employee such as Mr. Berger. Mr. Lopez knew Mr. Berger prior to retiring from working in the States Attorney’s Office as an investigator, but prior to that he was a Montgomery County Police officer.   Lying to a police officer is a crime and you should be bringing criminal charges against Mr. Berger and if you do not I will as well against Frank Lopez for suborning Mr. Berger to lie for him in this report so he could show a pattern. There is no doubt that Mr. Berger lied to or for Mr. Lopez or conspired with him to give this investigation credibility. The recent “perceived” threat Ms. Rona E. Kramer reported (daughter of Sidney Kramer)  it only says, (Rona Kramer perceived threat) and no mention of what she perceived as a threat. The fact is, I left several messages with several State Agencies in May or June of 2020, trying to find out what Federal Agency funded the Senior Meal Program for the State and County. I never asked to speak to anyone by name, only that I was trying to find out what Federal agency funded the program. No one ever called me back from the State. Soon after speaking to the USDA, I did receive a call from a Marla Capron from the County who told me she was asked to call me about the Senior Meals and to let me know that I do not have to answer these questions related to the Federal Agency. Since I left these messages on the States voicemail, and she perceived them as a personal threat to her, they should have made a copy of these messages, especially since Ms. Kramer Perceived and reported them as a threat to her. If no copy was made to support her accusations of this alleged threat to her, it would be filing a false police report and destroying evidence and abuse of government position, fraud and conspiracy.  Knowing the Kramers and what they are capable of, it is in my opinion or I should say, it would not surprise me at all that Rona Kramer paid Frank Lopez to fabricate as much as possible against Mr. Rosenberg to prevent him from ever owning a firearm.  Mrs. Rona Kramer has plenty of funds and I am sure a good deal in cash that could not be detected easily since one of her businesses is or was a car wash like her brother had.\\nI would like to know if they were told what this perceived threat was or have a voice copy of it or asked if there is a copy of this message. For them to investigate what is written only as a perceived threat without knowing what the alleged threat was seems ludicrous. If this was done, without the knowledge of what they perceived as a threat, it is no doubt giving special treatment to Kramer when they would not do this for any other citizen. \\nFrank Lopez wrote in an email to Michael Hegedus on June 3, 2020 that he made some minor corrections and additions to his report as well as. This is fraud, altering an official police report made by another officer. A police report should only state what their observations were and what they wrote when it was fresh in their mind. Not later told to please copy and paste the below narrative into you RMS Incident report and then submit it.  I cannot tell what Frank Lopez changed or altered. I can only assume you changed this to comply with what Rona Kramer told you to do and were paying you to do.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Spoke to their superiors, got no where, filing with IAD now but doubt they will do anything.

Having said that I am sending the police video of what was a stop sign violation off a rural road because I did not come to a complete stop. Every thing submitted is the honest and provable truth.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfkacPAJE4 the first ten minutes shows the violations. May have to copy/paste to your browser.\\n\\nBelow is the result of all my research on the legality of the stop. Do note the extension of my left hand with my license, registration and proof of insurance. \\nIn Ohio here is how it works. When stopped for a traffic violation you are initially in a state of “detention” not arrest. During this time Miranda in not read, however, anything you say can and will be used against you. Knowing this, I remained silent which I thought was my fifth amendment right and also because the officer never looked at these documents and I was partially misidentified by the dispatcher. The supreme court ruled in 2013 that you must INVOKE your intent to remain silent, however, those rights only become relevant if you are arrested. Now, if you remain silent as I did or even invoke it can be considered “suspicious behavior” by any cop which can result in a Terry stop where the office orders a citizen out of the vehicle and does a surface pat down for weapons. This was not done and I was ordered to exit my van under penalty of arrest if I refused. He was so close to my door I told him to step back twice then opened my van stepped out. I was told to put my hands up on the van which I did and said he had no right to do this and yes, I was not happy with this officer actions. He never stated that I was under arrest when he used an illegal choke hold and body slammed me across the road with the full weight of the cop on top of me. I was knocked out for a minute waking to hear the officer screaming at me to give my him my hands which I could not do because they were pinned under me. Now I am under arrest. I was seventy-three at the time with no criminal history. He then searched my van with no probable cause, no permission and no warrant and found nothing.\\nI have found no one in law who will discuss the legality of this arrest over the last five years including the attorney I hired who refused to go over the above video leaving me with little choice to plead to two counts of disorderly conduct. Apparently the prosecutor never saw the excessive force by the arresting officer in addition to the fourth amendment violation, just resisting arrest.\\nI have tried to get this out to people of what the supreme court is doing to our rights by offering a false sense of security in exchange for our God-given unalienable rights. Ben Franklin once was quoted as saying those who are willing to sacrifice their freedoms for security deserve neither. Look as these decisions by the supreme court and look for the common thread, Pennsylvania vs Mimms, Salinas vs Texas and Terry vs Ohio.  ALL OF THE PEOPLE I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT AND HAVE VIEWED THE POLICE VIDEO AND HAVE TAKEN AN OATH TO SUPPORT OUR CONSTUTUTION INGNORED MY WARNINGS. THEY INCLUDE A STATE REPRESENTATIVE, FIVE ATTORNEYS, A COUNTY SHERIFF, THE BAR ASSOCIATION, THE JUDICIAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE, MULTIPLE POLICE OFFICERS AND THE FBI.

my 3 Dutch born/Dutch Passports daughters with great violence and totally 1000% at June 14 2020 against their will, from their home country in The Netherlands  back to the USA. Despite Mr Trump travel ban from Europe. After me and the 3 girls fled the USA in November 2019. But international law forced them, against their strong will, back to the USA. My wife cheated on me and my girls for more than a year, divorced me behind my back, and then quickly married that person, being a US citizen. At the time of our stay we we\'re all illegal. After she left the Netherlands with the 3 girls everyone assumed she arrived safe in the USA. But instead was holed up in Mexico for two weeks, after which she illegally crossed the USA/Mexico border. I asked the police, believing at that time they we\'re in Las Vegas to check on my 3 girls. They did, and said all was well... But at he time my ex was still , unknowingly to everyone in the Netherlands, still in Ensenada/Mexico. So we wrongly believed the 3 girls we\'re at least sort of safe in LV. Then after almost two weeks came a cry for help from my 3 girls. From Mexico. From Ensenada, just before illegally crossing the border. We we\'re all totally flabbergasted, didn\'t the LV police confirmed the 3 girls we\'re ok and well..? didn\'t they contact them, spoke to them? And ever since I haven\'t heard from my 3 girls. 34 days of silence now.. Police won\'t go out again to check on them. Missing 3 girls is not a pressing matter to

Discourtesy","com_summary":"On 08/06/2017, Officer Weitzel of the Indianapolis PD thought it was necessary to turn on his spot light and speakers for me to pull over. In the middle of traffic in the LEFT turn lane into the Fashion Mall on 82nd street he gets out of his car and bangs on my window for me to turn off my engine. He yelled at me because I had not pulled over sooner saying he had followed me for 200 yards. I proceeded to tell him that I did not realize he was following me and when I did, I decided to pull into the nearest parking lot. He then conceded “that makes sense since you are a woman, but I didn’t know if you had a gun on you\\". I have no idea what he was insinuating with the first comment but it was striking and uncomfortable. In my mind, I was trying to pull over into a parking lot because it was much safer for myself and others if I had not stopped in the middle of a turn lane during heavy traffic. When I received my citation, it stated “running a red light” and that’s it. When I went to court for this issue, on the docket he added that I did not provide my car’s registration, which I did. Since this was not on the original ticket it was thrown out. Seeing as he blatantly added a new citation, it would be unsurprising if he has lied elsewhere on more important cases. I know this happened almost 3 years ago, but if it helps build a case against misconduct, then I feel I am doing my part. Considering his behavior toward a simple traffic violation, his aggressive temperament would lead me to believe that he is consistent with this brute force tactic resulting in the kind of police brutality that is coming to light.","com_tried_other_ways":"Y","com_tried_other_ways_desc":"Citizens Police Complaint Office of
